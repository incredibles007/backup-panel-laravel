# TODO list

- Add progress indicator on buttons and block buttons to prevent accidental duplicate clicks.
- Allow to download files from non-local disks.
- Allow to restore a backup (not certainly).
- Add tests.
- Provide an output for backup command.
- Show health status of backups and overall storage usage instead of only files list (output of `backup:list` command).
- Artisan commands for installing/upgrading the package.
